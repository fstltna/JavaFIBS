JavaFIBS2001 requires Java 2 v1.3 or better installed on your computer to be able to work.
There is a complete manual in the docs folder which describes how to operate JavaFIBS2001.
Read that first if there is something you are wondering about.

Installation notes
==================

Go to http://www.java.com/ and install the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) recommended by that site, if you haven't done so yet.
MacOSX users already have Java installed by default. To see if you already have it, bring up 
a console window, terminal window, or DOS Prompt and type "java -version" in it, or use the test on the www.java.com site.


Windows/MacOSX
--------------
To install JavaFIBS, unzip the JavaFIBS2001*.zip archive to any directory. Run the program by double-clicking on the JavaFIBS.jar file. 

Solaris/Linux/Unix/Others
--------------------------
Unzip the JavaFIBS2001.zip to a directory. Go to the dir and then type: "java -classpath JavaFIBS.jar JavaFIBS2001" or "java -jar JavaFIBS.jar".
