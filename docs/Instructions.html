<h1>JavaFIBS 2001 User Guide</h1>

<p>by Peter Nevalainen and Ingo Macherius</p>

<h2><a name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>JavaFIBS 2001 is a graphical interface for the <a
 href="http://www.fibs.com/">First Internet Backgammon Server
(FIBS)</a> . JavaFIBS is, as the name hints, completely made in java and should 
work on all computer systems with a Java 2 Runtime Environment v1.3 installed. JavaFIBS 2001 is able to run on Windows, Linux, Solaris,
and Mac OS X operation systems and it is possible that it
will work on OS/2 and AIX systems and
other platforms that the Java 2 engine has been developed for.</p>

<p>The official JavaFIBS homepage is located at <a
 href="http://www.fibs.com/javafibs/">http://www.fibs.com/javafibs/</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="getting_started"></a>2. Getting Started</h2>

<h3><a name="requirements"></a>2.1 Requirements</h3>

<p>JavaFIBS 2001 will need at least 32 Mb of main memory to run.
While JavaFIBS 2001 can be run on as low as ordinary P133
systems or similar, this will probably be too slow for most
people.</p>

<p>JavaFIBS 2001 also requires Java 2 Runtime Environment 1.3.1
or higher to run. The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) can be downloaded from <a
 href="http://www.java.com/">http://www.java.com/</a> . It is advisable 
to download the latest version available since it will probably work better and
faster with JavaFIBS 2001, but avoid beta versions.</p>
<P>MacOS X users already have a proper Java Runtime Environment installed with 
the operating system.</P>

<h3><a name="installation"></a>2.2 Installation</h3>

<p>To install JavaFIBS 2001 unzip the JavaFIBS2001.zip archive to
any directory. This can be achived with a program such as <a
 href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a> or the free <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7ZIP</a> for Windows computers or
unzip on other computer platforms.</p>

<h4><a name="javafibs_on_windows"></a>2.2.1 
Running JavaFIBS 2001 on Windows
and MacOSX</h4>

<p>To run JavaFIBS 2001 on Windows computers double click on the
JavaFIBS.jar file. If nothing happens or a dialog asks which
program to open JavaFIBS.jar with, you have probably do not have the Java 2 JRE 
installed properly.</p>

<h4><a name="javafibs_on_other"></a> 2.2.2 Running JavaFIBS
2001 on Solaris/Linux/Others</h4>

<p>Open a shell/console/terminal window and type: <font
 face="Fixedsys">java -jar JavaFIBS.jar when standing in the JavaFIBS2001 folder.</font></p>

you want.</p>

<h2><a name="graphical_board"></a>4. Graphical Board</h2>

<h3><a name="playing_on_board"></a>4.1 Playing on the Board</h3>

<p>This section describe how you interact with the checkers and
dice on the graphical board to play a game. While it is possible
to play on the board with a mouse with only one button, three
buttons are recommended for fastest and easiest play.</p>

<h4><a name="roll_dice"></a>4.1.1 Roll Dice</h4>

<p>To roll the dice click on the roll dice icon on the board. It
will only appear when it is your turn to roll or double.</p>

<h4><a name="move_checkers"></a>4.1.2 Move Checkers</h4>

<p>There are two ways of moving the checkers on the board. The
first one is dragging them by holding the mouse pointer over one,
press either mouse button and then move the checker to where you
want to place it while keeping the button pressed. You can only
place checkers on correct spots, otherwise they will jump back to
where they were dragged. The second way of moving the checkers is
by holding your mouse pointer over the checker you want to move
and then click either on the left or right mouse button. The left
mouse button will move the checker according to the left die and
the right mouse button will move the checker according to the
right die. When you have moved one checker, both mouse buttons
will move the next checker according to the die that is left to
move.</p>

<h4><a name="pickup_dice"></a>4.1.3 Pickup Dice</h4>

<p>When you have completed your move and want to send the it to
FIBS you have to click the left mouse button on the dice on the
board. </p>

<h4><a name="cube_handling"></a>4.1.4 Double/Accept/Reject Cube</h4>

<p>To double the cube you have to double click on the cube icon
on the board. To accept a cube offer from your opponent you also
have to double click on the cube icon which should be shown in
your opponent's dice area. To reject the cube, click on the
reject icon on the board (often shown as a red cross).</p>

<h4><a name="resign_handling"></a>4.1.5 Accept/Decline Resign</h4>

<p>When your opponent wants to resign, a resign icon (shown often
as a white flag) will appear on the board which shows what kind
of resign your opponent offers. If you double click on the resign
icon, you will accept your opponent's resignation. A reject icon
will also appear on the board (shown as a red cross) and by
clicking on that you will decline your opponent's offer.</p>

<h4><a name="undo_move"></a>4.1.6 Undo Move</h4>

<p>To undo a move not yet sent to FIBS you can click on the left
mouse button on the undo icon which is located in the middle of
the bar area or press the middle mouse button anywhere on the
board if you have one. The latter is only useable if you have set
your middle mousebutton to work as the third mousebutton.</p>

<h4><a name="swap_dice"></a>4.1.7 Swap Dice</h4>

<p>JavaFIBS 2001 always put the player's highest die to the left
in the dice area when it's the player's turn to move. If you only
have one mouse button or just want to use your left mouse button
on the board, you can switch the places of the dice by clicking
on them before you make any move.</p>

<h3><a name="board_toolbar"></a>4.2 Board Toolbar</h3>

<h4><img alt="" 
src="..\images\undo.gif" align="textTop" 
border=1> &nbsp;Undo Moves</h4>

<p>This button will take back all the moves you have made 
so far for this turn. Moves already sent to FIBS cannot be taken back.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/autoroll.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Autoroll Dice</h4>

<p>This button sends the toggle double command to FIBS. The
setting will be reset after each game point so you will have to
press the button each game to autoroll. One exception to this is
when you have one point from winning the match, then the default
value will be that it will not ask you to double but roll the
dice automatically.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/greedy.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Greedy Checker Bear Off</h4>

<p>This button will send the toggle greedy command to FIBS. This
means it will move home as many checkers it can automatically
when you are able to bear off. Beware, it will do so even if your
opponent still is able to hit you. The command will be set to off
after every game.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/resign.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Resign</h4>

<p>This button will let you resign the game you are playing. A
dialog will pop up so you can offer offer points between a normal
(1 x cube), gammon (2 x cube) or backgammon (3 x cube)
resignation to your opponent.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/newboard.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Refresh Board</h4>

<p>This button will send a board command to FIBS to receive a
fresh board from the server. This is useful if something weird
has happened to the board or if you did a look on someone that
brings up someone else's board.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/checkertarget.gif"
 width="16" align="textTop" border=1 > Checker Target Help</h4>

<p>When this button is pressed it will show all places that a
dragged checker can move to. It will also light up the target
when you are above it when dragging so it will be easier to drop
the checker on the right place. The latter is only available on
the bitmap boards due to technical issues.</p>

<h4><img alt="" 
src="..\images\pipcount.gif" align="textTop" 
border=1>           
           
             
           
     &nbsp;Pip Count</h4>

<p>           
           
             
   When this button is pressed, the pip count will
be shown next to the players' scores.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/loadboard.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Load Logged Match</h4>

<p>This button will let you load a logged match back into
JavaFIBS 2001 to review it.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/saveboard.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Save Board</h4>

<p>This button will let you save the current board into different
formats for different purposes. Currently only ASCII and
JellyFish .pos formats are supported.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/fastreverse.gif"
 width="16" align="textTop" border=1 > Previous Game</h4>

<p>This button will scroll back to find the previously stored
game start and show that on screen.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/reverse.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Previous Board</h4>

<p>This button will show the previously stored board on screen.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/forward.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Next Board</h4>

<p>This button will show the next stored board on screen.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/fastforward.gif"
 width="16" align="textTop" border=1 > Next Game</h4>

<p>This button will scroll forward to find the next stored game
start and show that on screen.</p>

<h4>The Board Counter</h4>

<p>The numbers divided by a slash ( / ) to the furthest right on the
toolbar is showing the present board and the total amount of
stored boards. The first number shows which board is currently
shown on screen. A - means the last stored board. The number
after the slash shows how many boards there are in total in the
match stored in memory.</p>

<h3><a name="board_settings"></a>4.3 Board Settings</h3>

<p>You can change the appearance on the graphical board with the <em>Board...</em>
option in the <em>Preferences</em> menu. The following sections
describe the settings you can change</p>

<h4><a name="board_list"></a>4.3.1 Board List</h4>

<p>First you can decide if you want to use a resizable vector
board or a fixed sized bitmap board. The biggest difference is
that the vector board is resizable and the bitmap boards are not.
If you select to use the bitmap board, you have a few already
made boards with different graphical appearance to choose from.
If you are not satisfied with the boards that is included you can
draw your own and use with JavaFIBS 2001. See section <A
 href="Instructions.html#creating_custom_boards" >4.4 Creating a
Custom Board</A>. The information area to the right of the list
displays some information about all the boards.</p>

<h4><a name="board_view"></a>4.3.2 Board View</h4>

<p>This part lets you decide if you want to play clockwise or
counter-clockwise. Normally in JavaFIBS 2001 you play by moving
your checkers from top right to bottom right. By setting the view
to mirrored you will instead play from top left to bottom left.</p>

<h4><a name="board_translucency"></a>4.3.3 Board Translucency</h4>

<p>This option lets you select the translucency level on the
checkers and dice. The values range from fully opaque (default)
to 50% translucency level.</p>

<h4><a name="vector_board_textures"></a>4.3.4 Vector Board
Textures and Colours</h4>

<p>This option will let you change the colours and textures on
the vector board. The less textures you use, the faster the
vector board will be drawn and therefore faster to play on. Play
around with the settings to find the optimal balance between
textures complexity and speed.</p>

<h3><a name="creating_custom_boards"></a>4.4 Creating a Custom
Board</h3>

<p>Follow these steps to make your own board to use with JavaFIBS
2001.</p>

        </ul>
    <li>Make two text files named normal.metrics and
        reverse.metrics. In these textfiles you type in where on
        the board the different areas are as starting points with
        an x and y coordinate. The size of the areas are entered
        at the end like tuples of width and height in pixels. The
        coordinates and size must be separated with a comma-sign
        (,) such as 0,0. You can also modify one of the files in
        the existing boards. The normal.metrics file is used when
        you are playing counter-clockwise starting in the top
        right corner and the reverse is used when playing
        clockwise starting in the top left corner. The
        coordinates must be placed in rows in the following
        order: <ul>
            <li>top left coordinate of the left die position for the 
    player. 
            <li>top left coordinate of the right die for the player. 

            <li>top left coordinate of the left die for the 
    opponent. 
            <li>top left coordinate of the right die for the 
    opponent. 
            <li>top left coordinate of the cube location when the 
    player owns the cube. 
            <li>top left coordinate of the cube location when the 
    opponent owns the cube. 
            <li>top left coordinate of the cube location when it has 
    not been doubled yet. 
            <li>top left coordinate of the cube location when the 
    cube just has been doubled. 
            <li>bottom left coordinate of the player's bar area 
    (where checkers are moved to when hit). 
            <li>top left coordinate of the opponent's bar area. 
            <li>bottom left coordinate of the player's home area 
    (where the checkers are moved when borne off). 
            <li>top left coordinate of the opponent's home area. 
            <li>top left coordinate of the roll dice area (where the 
    roll picture will appear). 
            <li>top left coordinate of the resign area (where the 
    resign pictures will appear). 
            <li>top left coordinate of the reject area (where the 
    reject picture for resigns and doubles will appear). 
            <li>top left coordinate of the join area (this is 
    currently unused in this version of JavaFIBS 2001 but needs to be entered as 
    well). 
            <li>top left coordinate of the undo area. 
            <li>top left coordinate of the upper point number 
    pictures. 
            <li>top left coordinate of the lower point number 
    pictures. 
            <li>top left coordinate of the top right point area 
    (point 1 in normal and point 12 in reverse). 
            <li>top left coordinates of the rest of the top 
    points... 
            <li>top left coordinate of the bottom left point area 
    (point 13 in normal and point 24 in reverse). 
            <li>top left coordinates of the rest of the lower 
    points... 
            <li>the width and height of a point area. 
            <li>the width and height of a normal checker. 
            <li>the width and height of a home checker. 
            <li>the width and height of the roll dice area. 
            <li>the width and height of the join area. 
            <li>the width and height of the reject area. 
            <li>the width and height of a die. 
            <li>the width and height of the undo area. 
            <li>the width and height of the cube. 
            <li>the width and height of the resign area.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Make a snapshot picture of the board and shrink it so 
  the width becomes 150 pixels. Name it thumbnail.gif. 
    <li>Create a textfile called information.metrics and type 
  in your name in it. 
    <li>Name your board by creating a folder/directory with 
  that name and put all the files in it. Avoid using special characters and 
  whitespace in the name and make sure you do not have a board with that name 
  already. 
    <li>Put the folder in the JavaFIBS2001/boards/ folder. Now
        you can select your board in the board list when you open
        the preferences for the board. </li>
</ol>

<p>Note: The dice area should be at least two dice in height and
one die width from each other since JavaFIBS randomize the
location for each dice with a value from 0 to half a dice from
each die location.</p>

<h2><a name="players"></a>5 Players</h2>

<p>The Players table shows the users that are currently logged in
on FIBS. It is dynamically updated so it always shows
the current status of the players. By double clicking with the
left mouse button or click on the right mouse button on a user
will bring up a popup menu where you can perform different
actions on that user such as invite him or mark him as a friend. </p>

<h3><a name="players_toolbar"></a>5.1 Players Toolbar</h3>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/pready.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Show Ready Users</h4>

<p>When this button is pressed it will show the ready users in
the player table. If it is not pressed those users will not
appear in the list.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/ponline.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Show On-Line Users</h4>

<p>This button decides if you want to see those players that are
neither playing nor ready to be invited in the player table. </p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/pplaying.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Show Playing Users</h4>

<p>This button lets you decide if you want to show the users that
are currently playing a game in the player table.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/punknown.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Show Unknown Users</h4>

<p>This button lets you decide if you want to see those players
that have a status that is undefinable. They turn into this state
if they are playing and their opponent leaves FIBS. It is
uncertain if they are in the ready state or the on-line state
when this happens.</p>

<h4>Pts:</h4>

<p>This box will let you set the amount of points you want to
play when you invite someone. It affects both the invite in the
player table and the invite in the invitation table. Resume means
you want to invite someone to finish a currently saved game you
have with that person and unlimited means you want to play a
match which will never end with someone.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/invite.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Invite User to a Match</h4>

<p>This button will send an invitation to the currently selected
person in the player table. That person will be invited to play
the number of points you have selected in the point box to the
left of this button.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/wand.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Auto Invite User to a Match</h4>

<p>This button will let you set the interface to watch for
someone to become available to play with. When the selected
person becomes available JavaFIBS 2001 will then automatically
invite that person to a match with the points you select. This
comes in handy if you for example are trying to play one of the
bots on FIBS so you do not have to guard it yourself.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/updatetable.gif"
 width="16" align="textTop" border=1 > Update Table</h4>

<p>This button clears the whole player table and then reloads all
users into it. This may be necessary occasionally due to bugs in
FIBS which will cause some commands to vanish which is necessary
for a correct update of the table.</p>

<h4>In:</h4>

<p>This number shows how many players are currently logged in on
FIBS.</p>

<h2><a name="friends"></a>6 Friends</h2>

<p>JavaFIBS 2001 lets you keep track of your friends in an easy
way. All friends you have added will be shown here and their
current status if they are logged on or not and what they do if
they are on. You can colour your friends so they will become
easier to spot in the player table or when they appear in the
text areas. You will also always be notified when one of your
friends log in, even if you do not show when the users enter and
leave.</p>

<h3><a name="friends_toolbar"></a>6.1 Friends Toolbar</h3>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/happysmiley.gif"
 width="16" align="textTop" border=1 > Add Friend</h4>

<p>This button opens up a dialog where you can enter your
friend's name. It is necessary to type in the name exactly as it
appears in FIBS with both upper and lower case letters.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/colour.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Colour Friend</h4>

<p>This button lets you change the colour on your friend. This
colour is the colour that will appear in the players table and in
the text areas when this person appears.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/removesmiley.gif"
 width="16" align="textTop" border=1 > Remove Friend</h4>

<p>This button removes the currently selected person in the
friend list.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/chat.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Chat With Friend</h4>

<p>This button will open up a separate chat window to let you
speak with your friend. Will only work if the friend is logged
into FIBS.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/message.gif" width="16"
 align="textTop" border=1 > Leave Message for Friend</h4>

<p>This button lets you leave a message to your friend which
(s)he will receive next time (s)he logs in. If the person is
already in, (s)he will receive the message instantly.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/querysmiley.gif"
 width="16" align="textTop" border=1 > Whois Friend</h4>

<p>This button will send a <em>whois &lt;user&gt; </em>command to
FIBS to fetch the information about your friend. The information
will be displayed in the System text area.</p>

<h3><a name="friends_popup_menu"></a>6.2 Friends Popup Menu</h3>

<p>You can bring up a popup menu by double clicking on the left
mouse button or by clicking on the right mouse button on a friend
in the table. The entries are just the same as those found in the
toolbar.</p>

<h3><a name="friends_table"></a>6.3 Friends Table</h3>

<p>There are three column in the friends table. The column named
On shows <img height="16" src="../images/connect.gif"
 width="16" align=absMiddle > if that friend is online and nothing if
(s)he is not. The Name column contains the name of the friend and
the friend's name has the colour which that friend will have when
(s)he appears in tables or text areas. The Status column shows
what the friend is doing in FIBS if (s)he is logged on.</p>

<h2><a name="villains"></a>7. Villains</h2>

<p>JavaFIBS 2001 lets you ignore the people you do not want to
listen to. All persons you add to this list will not be shown
wether they try to talk to you, shout or log in/out. They will
not appear in the invitation table either and you won't see any
messages left to you from them either. In the Players table they
will appear with a light gray colour. If they try to watch any of
your matches they will immediately be banned from the match since
JavaFIBS 2001 sends the <em>blind &lt;user&gt;</em> command if
that happens. Remember, they will still be able to hear you when
you shout or speak .</p>

<h3><a name="villains_toolbar"></a>7.1 Villains Toolbar</h3>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/angrysmiley.gif"
 width="16" align="textTop" border=1 > Add Villain </h4>

<p>This button will let you enter a new villain into to the
table.</p>

<h4><img height="16" src="../images/removesmiley.gif"
 width="16" align="textTop" border=1 > Remove Villain</h4>

<p>This button will remove the selected villain from the table to
become an ordinary person again.</p>

<h2><a name="invitations"></a>8. Invitations</h2>

<p>The table to the top right are for displaying and
handling incoming invitations from other players. When someone
invites you, his or her name will appear in the table along with
some of the person's details. The table also shows how many
rating points you will gain if you win and how many rating points
you will lose if you lose the match. By double clicking on the
left mouse button or single click on the right mouse button on a
person in the table a popup menu will appear where you can decide
what to do with the invitation.</p>

<h3><a name="invitations_popup_menu"></a>8.1 Invitations Popup
Menu</h3>

<h4>Join</h4>

<p>This option will accept the person's invitation and start
playing with the person.</p>

<h4>Decline</h4>

<p>This option will send a message to the inviter declining the
invitation. You can change the message with the <em>Decline
Message... </em>option in the <em>Preferences</em> menu</p>

<h4>Ignore</h4>

<p>This option will just remove the invitation from the table
without doing anything else. </p>

<h4>Invite</h4>

<p>This option will invite the inviter to the number of points
you currently have selected in the players table.</p>

<h2><a name="matches"></a>9. Matches</h2>

<p>With JavaFIBS 2001 you can save your matches to replay them
later on the JavaFIBS 2001 graphical board or convert them to
other formats for other programs.</p>

<h3><a name="save_matches"></a>9.1 Save Matches</h3>

<p>JavaFIBS 2001 is able to save your matches you play and/or
watch automatically. The <em>Log Matches...</em> in the <em>Preferences</em>
menu lets you decide when to save the matches. The default is
that all matches you play will be saved but not when you are
watching. The matches are saved in an internal match format (see
9.4 JavaFIBS 2001 Match Format). Some matches may not be saved
properly because they have been interrupted in the middle or some
FIBS output has disappeared. JavaFIBS 2001 tries to save as much
information about these matches anyhow.</p>

<h3><a name="replay_matches"></a>9.2 Replay Saved Matches</h3>

<p>You can replay the old matches that have been saved in
JavaFIBS 2001. By clicking on <img height="16"
 src="../images/loadboard.gif" width="16" align=absBottom > in the Board's toolbar
you will be presented with all matches that has currently been
saved in JavaFIBS 2001. After you have selected a match to
review, the match will be loaded into the graphical board for you
to scroll through with the use of the arrow buttons.</p>

<h3><a name="convert_matches"></a>9.2 Export Matches</h3>

<p>If you want to use your saved matches in another program, you
may want to convert them to a format that can be read by them.
Most, if not all, backgammon programs can read the JellyFish .mat
format and is therefore the chosen format that JavaFIBS 2001 will
convert the matches to. You find the match converter in the <em>Tools</em>
menu</p>

<h3><a name="internal_format"></a>9.3 JavaFIBS 2001 Match Format</h3>

<p>JavaFIBS 2001 keeps the matches saved in an internal text format. The first line shows the kind of
text file it is. The rest shows the match. All commands are represented
by a number and after that number the data for that
command comes separated by a colon (:). The commands and their
number and data are described in the table below, which represents version 1.1
of the format.</p>

<h2><a name="programmable_buttons"></a>10. Programmable Buttons</h2>

<p>         In JavaFIBS
2001 you can add new customised buttons to the top toolbar. When
you select <em>Programmable Buttons</em> from the <em>Preferences</em> menu a 
small window will open up that lets you add, remove, or change the contents 
in a button. To add a button, insert the command you want to 
have on this button in the text field, the picture it should have, and then 
press the <em>add</em> button. To change the command or icon for a 
button, you first select the button. Then alter the command in the text 
field or icon and then press the <em>update</em> button. The four 
buttons to the right of the text field will let you insert special tags into the 
command of a button, which will let you interact with the interface better (see 
below). When you are finished with all buttons, press <em>ok</em>.
            
          
           
           
           
          
       . The commands will be
saved after you have closed JavaFIBS 2001. </p>

<p>          
           
             The tags
and their functionality are you can use in the commands
are:</p>
<UL>
    <li><strong>%Player</strong> - This tag will be substitited
        by the currently selected person in the <em>Players</em> table when the command is sent to FIBS. 
    <li><strong>%Friend</strong> - This tag will be substituted
        by the currently selected person in the <em>Friends</em> table when the command is sent to FIBS. 
    <li><strong>%Villain</strong> - This tag will be substituted
        by the currently selected person in the <em>Villains</em> table when the command is sent to FIBS. 
    <li><strong>%Opponent</strong> - This 
  tag will be substituted by your last played opponent in this session when the command is sent to FIBS. 
    <li><strong>%Inviter</strong> - This tag will be 
  substituted by the selected inviter in the <em>Invitation</em>      
               table when the
        command is sent to FIBS.</li></UL>
<P>Note: These tags can also be used in the autothank, autogreet and decline 
messages.</P>

<p>Example1: You want a greet button for your friends. Then in
the text field in the programmable button you want to use you can
write: "tell %Friend Hi! How are you doing today?" and
every time you push this button it will send this greeting to the
selected friend in the <em>Friends</em> table.</p>

<p>Example 2: You want a button that will ask the selected person
in the <em>Players</em> table if he wants to play: "tell
%Player Would you like to play a 5 point match?"</p>

<h2><a name="relocating_folders"></a>11. Relocating Data and Resource Folders</h2>

Starting with version 1.010, JavaFIBS 2001 supports relocating it's folder locations. This still is an experimental feature likely
to envolve further, so please use it with care. There are three Java properties which can be changed before program startup. How to set 
properties for your Java is system and version dependent, please consult the Java documentation for details.

			<td>./user</td>
			<td>The directory where user preferences and statistics are stored. You need read and write priviledges for
				this directory.	Subfolders such as ${com.fibs.javafibs.home.user}/user/username will be created on demand.

		<tr>
			<td><tt>com.fibs.javafibs.home</tt></td>
			<td>./</td>
			<td>The directory where program resources such as images, textures, and sound files are stored.
			     You need read only priviledges for
				this directory.	The directory layout of this folder needs to be identical to the structure of 
				the original JavaFIBS 2001 ZIP file, excluding the "user" and "matches" subfolders.

<p>Example: When starting JavaFIBS 2001 from a shell, you can set the location where matches are recorded like so:</p>
<tt>java -jar -Dcom.fibs.javafibs.home.matches="c:/backgammon/javafibs/savedgames" JavaFIBS2001.jar</tt> 
 <p>
 The path names given as parameters of the properties can either be path names in your OS's native syntax, pathnames using the single
 slash path separator (/), or file URL as per RFC 1738. It should be safest to just use native OS path syntax, however.
