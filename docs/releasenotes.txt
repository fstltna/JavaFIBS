Here are the notes about user visible changes for each version in JavaFIBS 2001.


Changes and fixes:

v1.011 (20080317)
------
* Change: Use a darker color for numeric labels in statistic graph, former color was hard to read on grey background (inim)
* Fix: Newly created "User Programmable Button" did not appear in the GUI (or appeared broken, depending on JDK version) (bug 093, inim)
* Fix: "Automatic Jellyfish export" did not work as advertised (bug 085, inim)
* Fix: First login after running with non-existing preferences (either new install or new user) failed to login at first attempt (inim)
* Fix: Profile Names with space(s) caused login problems, plus some more tricky PPP parser stability improvements (bug 089, inim)
* Fix: Unnecessary textures and untested boards erraneously shipped with 1.010, reverted to 1.009 w/r to both (bug 087, inim)
* Fix: Worked around a parser bug which sometimes crashed JF after FIBS quakes, it now silently recovers (bug 097, inim)

v1.010 (20080309)
------
* Change: GTK look and feel for Unix systems supported (bug 017, inim)
* Change: Path names for Resources, Saved Matches and User prefs are no longer hardcoded and can be set by the user (see docs section 11) (bug 067, inim)
* Change: Repbot context menus added to player and inviter tables (bug 007, inim)

* Change: New Preferences option to automatically save all matches in both internal and Jellyfish format (inim) 
* Change: Countrycodes have been updated to contain all existing nations (Jan 2008) as per ISO 3166-2 definition (inim) 
* Change: The "refresh" button of the player list sends the "who" command 4 times now, setting sortorder to rrating, rating, name, and login respectively. This should work around the "invisible player" problem a lot better (inim)
* Change: New naming scheme for saved matches: Player_vs_Opponent_YYYYMMDDHHMMSSNNNN, where Y=Year, M=Month, D=Day, H=Hour, M=Minute, S=Seconds and N=Milliseconds (inim)
* Change: Updated ID list of clients supporting PPP (PlayerProfileProtocol) (TourneyBot, JavaCLIPLib, and Delfibs) (inim)
* Change: Sorting match length in statistics dialog is now in numerical order (was A-Z), sorting opponent names is now case insensitive (bug 027, inim)
* Fix: Sound was distorted when using JDK 1.5 and up on Windows - probably on other systems too (bug 016, inim)
* Fix: Saving positions from match recorder button crashed. Works again, positions can be saved as ASCII or Jellyfish *.pos files (bug 019, inim)
* Fix: Don't intercept ctrl-x key input anymore, it interferes with cut/paste shortcuts (switched to command mode before) (inim)
* Fix: Problems with I/O when loading or saving Preferences, Friends, Villain, Buttons, and other Resources are handled more graceful now. (inim)
