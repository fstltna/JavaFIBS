This protocol is for carrying brief player profiles in the client field in the FIBS CLIP 
protocol.

The client field can hold up to 20 7-bit ASCII characters. The possible useable characters
ranges from the numbers 33 to 126 or 0100001 to 1111110 in binary.

The characters in the player profile protocol are divided as follows


Char1: Identifies this protocol and holds the gender of the player

01111 xy 
----- -- 
 |    |  
 |   specifies the gender (00 = male ">", 10 = female "<", 01 = computer "=", 11 = unknown "?")
specifies that this protocol is used (60) (along with a string length of 20).


Char2-3: Player's country which is specified by the (capital) two letter country code,
ie SE for Sweden and US for USA. Non specified country should be NT (Neutral Zone).


Char4-19: Player's name. The first letters in the first and last name muststart with a
capital letter and only A-Z, a-z and the underscore character _ (simulates space char)
are allowed in the name. To not waste a character for a space between first and last
name the first letter in the last name is subtracted with 30 so it becomes a non legal
letter character but stays in the range of legal characters for the CLIP. The first non
legal character is added with 30 to become legal again when parsing the CLIP client field.
Unused positions must be filled with the underscore character _.


Char20: Specifies the client using this protocol.
